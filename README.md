# PowerPoint_to_sketch
Create an Arduino Sketch from a VB macro in a PowerPoint presentation.

This PowerPoint presentation and the included VB macro is based on the work by [Kris Kasprzak here](https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/Powerpoint-ILI9341_t3).

The original VB macro created by Kris is part of the presentation, it has been expanded and enhanced with extra capabilities.

The example presentation creates an Arduino sketch that renders on a 480x320 TFT screen. This uses the fonts provided in the TFT_eSPI_ext library by Frank Boesing. Frank's library can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/FrankBoesing/TFT_eSPI_ext).
